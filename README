1) Dataset: Please check the paper for details on dataset and how it was processed to obtain POD time coefficients. The data in this
repo consists of the POD \alpha_{t} computed from the datasets obtained at http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/.
All scripts for downloading slices of the DNS datasets can be a found at this link.

2) The codes (.py files and Ipython notebooks) are provided to be run directly from the directory

3) The training folder contains codes to train the LSTM model for the given input

4) Analysis folder contains Ipython notebooks to visualize results of the LSTM model.


The .h5 are the trained models which can be directly used for modeling from the Ipython notebooks.
The .npz files are compressed files which show the loss vs training epochs - can be visualized from the
analysis codes to study training performance.


Please contact me if there are any comments/clarifications. Also, if you find the codes useful in your research
please cite our work.

LSTM ROM for turbulent flow control - arxiv 1804.09269
A Deep Learning based Approach to Reduced Order Modeling
for Turbulent Flow Control using LSTM Neural Networks


1) Dataset: Please check the paper for details on dataset and how it was processed to obtain POD time coefficients. The data in this
repo consists of the POD \alpha_{t} computed from the datasets obtained at http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/.
All scripts for downloading slices of the DNS datasets can be a found at this link.

2) The codes (.py files and Ipython notebooks) are provided to be run directly from the directory

3) The training folder contains codes to train the LSTM model for the given input

4) Analysis folder contains Ipython notebooks to visualize results of the LSTM model.
